"{{site.description}}"

The idea of this was to try and get into writing something.  I don't necessarily mind if it is good or not, but the creative process of writing anything was important to get away from the pure consumption lifestyle of TV/Podcasts I sometimes slide into.

I will try to write a short paragraph each day, or maybe a few in advance so it continues to publish whilst I am away.

The stories will all sit on github in the code, and are available to all to read.

If you have any questions, or would like to contact me about these posts, please contact email me at: paradayish AT retrobadger DOT net

## But why Paradayish?
Well, simply put, the original idea was to do a paragraph a day, then I figured I may do more/less/none on some days, hence the ish.
