Now that it has fully emerged from the clouds, he can see the entirity of this blimp as it groaned overhead.  Based on size alone, it has no right to be in the sky.  Even if it were empty it would way more than a small village surely, let alone if it is housing a small army of individuals (at this point, he is not confident whether they are people, for some reason, the idea that they are not is worth entertaining, it would at least keep his day interesting).

He can see the dots on top of the cage clammering around a solid structure, bringing parts to it from other rooms within the ship, building something in the sky, as if it were the most adult a lego set  you could get.  Whilst the dots are moving fast, and appearing irratic, there are no collisions, and slowly a pattern appears, giving a balletic quality to this madness in the sky.  But only shortly after he notices the pattern, all dots descend to the device, ceasing any movement.  It appeared that whatever they were trying to achieve, is now done, and the time was approaching to test whatever this new toy was.  A loud clanking noise descends from the sky, like that you would here in a shipyard as anchors are raised from the depths.
