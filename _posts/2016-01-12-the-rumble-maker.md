As the rumble approaches the lake where he lies, the man attempts to pinpoint its source.  Gazing around above him, a swirl appears in the clouds, peeling them away as if a banana skin.  Slowly, from the centre of this maelstrom in the sky, begins to emerge the start of a cream cone, with bronze cables strapped down tight, going from the point of the object, slowly towards the rear (at least, as far as he can see).  As more  cone starts to emerge, the sheer scale of this object hits home.  It easily blots out the entire landscape below (of which, our man is in the center of, starting to wonder whether staying still is such a good plan), there are also whole colonies of birds that appear to have nested on top.

Finally, after more and more of the losenge comes into view, something else pops through the cloud to the cones base, a large and sturdy looking brown cage.  Granted that it looks tiny in comparison to the main ship, but that was just the whole 'objects far away' thing taught to many a child (and Father Dougal).  From this distance, you can see the cage is in fact a solid bronze box, with several vertical wooden struts up the side, giving the impression of a cage, but was in fact is an extremely solid shelter.  He starts to see small beings move across in the distance, scampering all over the box, opening what must be doors.  Counting the doors, there must be at least 5 floors to this ship, and about 20 cabins across, confirming that this is not a small ship.  For a second he wonders whether there is a bar on board, or at the very list, a sneaky bottle of bourbon in the captains desk, he could really do with a quiet drink to parch his thirst, and block away all forms of panic which could start to emerge soon.
