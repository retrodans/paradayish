After much thinking, the crow has a light-bulb moment, jumping over to the back of the drawers, and leaning over the side to see what was down there.   It appears the cabinet had no back (why on earth they felt a lock was useful in such cabinets is a mystery).  There is just enough space, due to the warped wall, for the crow to jump down behind the drawer.  It leans it's black left wing against the drawer and pushes, slowly edging the drawer out, one centimeter at a time.  Considering the size of the bird, this was quite the incredible feat, and I am sure that it will be on the lookout for some further imaginary adoration and gifts after this caper was over with.  Once the drawer was protruding by about a foot, the rook jumps back onto the table, finally able to look down inside of the drawer, to see the wonders awaiting inside.
