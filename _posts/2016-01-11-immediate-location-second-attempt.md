He closes his eyes, and focuses on his immediate senses: touch, smell, sound

The first thing he notices is the soft tickle at the nape of his neck, it is grass, which makes sense if he is lying beside water.

There is also a soothing breeze hitting his cheek, but at the same time, causing a rustle amongst several trees that must be scattered around.

Along with the rustle of leaves, there is a lot of chatter in the trees.

All is peaceful in what feels like a park, something akin to those found in London.  There are no direct threats, or shocks to consider, maybe going back to sleep isn't such a bad idea, the next time he may be more refreshed and ready to think.

But then, before he can rest, there is a rumble from behind the trees.
