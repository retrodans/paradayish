So, it has been a while since I posted a new part of Paradayish.  I did backstory Bob, but that was on a whim.  The bad news is, I don't have the time to keep it up in this manner, the intention was to do a small amount a day, but getting my mind into the correct place to write in this world is a lot of effort, especially with everything else I am trying to do.

There is a silver lining though, this is not the end of my writing, nor of Paradayish.

Paradayish will stay, and I may write more one shots for fun.  The main story will stay, and if I get bored in the holidays, I may continue writing parts, and even return properly in the future.

My other writing, well, I have recently joined a gaming group, and we are posting journal entries as we play.  This is taking a lot of my creative time, and so of course, there is a website to see it all if you would like (my name is D'rith on that site).

All the best in the future to anybody reading this, and I hope this isn't the end.
