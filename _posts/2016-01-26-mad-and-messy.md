The owner of this room though, even with all the storage capacity available, did not appear to class tidiness as one of the more important things in life.  Which is often surprising for a scientist (mad or otherwise) as they would surely at least have some system for ordering their work, whether that be alphabetical, numeric, magic symbols, or even the connotations formed by the smell of the paper it was written on (we did mention they might be mad).  But here the system appears to be, if you want a piece of paper, look in a drawer, or maybe on top of the drawers, or the wall, then again, maybe the floor is a good place for such thinkgs.  Surprisingly, the ceiling was kept clear, save for a few hanging lights, suspended using solid metal chains, the bulbs were nearly the size of a mans head, which is surely not a great idea with all the wood and paper lying about.  The drawers in the room were left mostly open, some appear as though an attempt to shut them was made, but the paper stuffed inside them tried to escape and prevented it.
