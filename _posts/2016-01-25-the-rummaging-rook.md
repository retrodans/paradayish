As the Rooks eyes become accustomed to the flickering light, the room begins to take shape.  The first thing of notice is the sheer quantity of mahogony drawers in the room, each of varied size and design.  Some were solid wood, others had intricate designs carved into them, a few were old, and the rest were possibly only just installed in the room.  There must literally be a half dozen cabinets in this room, each with another half-dozen drawers each (for those that cannot be bothered with math, this makes about 36 drawers - unless you use a bakers dozen and round up, in which case we are talking about 49 drawers.  But understand now, no-one does that, so 36 it is).  Even though the room is filled with all this storage, don't go thinking it is a particularly large space though, we are only talking maybe a 15' square area, with no more than 7' high walls.  The cabinets are spread out all around the room, some even stacked upon one another just so more could fit inside.  The walls appear to be of a batten and board style as far as can be seen behind the organised clutter.  Therefore the impression is that if the room was left empty, it could have been quite a nice room to relax in with a book and a cup of tea, an estate agent would have no problem renting it out as a 'luxury double bedroom, with ornate woodwork, and excellend transport connections'.
