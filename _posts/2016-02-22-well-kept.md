He is just lying there, in the least dusty room on the ship so far, staring at the ceiling with a look as though he is chasing something, possibly a strand of memory, but then it could just as easily be a departing bus.  The room as well decorated, with cabinets on the sides, and the single bed he is lying on appears to have been kept in good condition, and the sheets only recently laid out, as though they were expecting a visitor worth looking after.  The walls wore the usual wood panelling seen everywhere on this ship, with brass pipes edging the walls, some lightly scorching the walls with heat, and others having strange funnel like ends, for shouting through.  Finally the Rook looks over towards the door, it is shut, and even if locked, it appeared fairly flimsy, certainly nothing worth calling a cell.  So what was this all about?
