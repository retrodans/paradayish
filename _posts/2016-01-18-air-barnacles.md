As the crane settles onto the airships boards, the one-time dots (now, at least humanoid on shape) surrounding the crane detach the cables connecting it to the lifting device before tidying everything away.  Pulling apart the lego-like structure which had been created, and tidying their toys away neatly, just like every parents dream.  The man feigns unconsciousness, and allows those around him to detach the crane, and carry him away.  They seem gentle (well, as gentle as sailors can be), and rest him on a soft bed in a room, granted they chain his ankle, and lock the door, but that only seems fair.  The time for resting was over though, now it was time to think (not just about whether there is such a thing as air-barnacles), and if possible, remember.
