Watching this scene, you would be excused if you did not understand the next few minutes.  Whilst Rooks are known for being quite intelligent creatures, they don't exactly tame well, and certainly don't take orders.  They go so far as to consider themselves royalty, not just to a trivial physical region (such as a country), but to everything it can see. To this end, they consider that all other creatures, whether they can fly or not, are mere common folk not worth their time, especially those that cannot even levitate themselves from the dirty soiled earth.  In fact, the ONLY creatures that do deserve to fly are Rooks, and for one good reason, they could rip out your eye in a single swoop (it's true, honest, I heard it once down the local pub).

For 5 minutes, the 2 creatures stare at one another, neither moving, neither giving in to the other, a proper chess stalemate, rook against pawn.  That is until the Rook cranes its neck in the most theatrical of bows, and jumps off the mans chin, onto the ground.  It proceeds to walk a few feet away, than takes off, flying high into the sky, circling in the sky before flying off towards some trees in the distance.
