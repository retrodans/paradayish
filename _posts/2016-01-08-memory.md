The expression on the mans face, after having lain alone for the last few minutes, starts to change.  But not to a rendition of anger, hatred, or anything so sad.  But there is a hint of confusion starting to spread across his face as he realises the situation he is in.  A memory shoots across his mind, hitting him hard, nearly leaving a slap mark across his cheek.

He recalls walking to this spot in an evening.  But not walking, more staggering.  Damn, was he drunk?  Not the cool drunk where you wear sunglasses all the time, and pace the nightclu to the beat, but the embarrassing drunk of a 16 year old.  Surely, if it is your memory, you would at least seem a little more elegant in everything you do, wouldn't you?  It's only fair, you are the director of your life after all?  In his drunken stupor he started to fall, but not in the usual messy way reminiscent of a dropped accordion, but in a much more methodical sort of collapse, which ultimately resulted in that same restful sleeping pose the Rook came across earlier in the morning.
