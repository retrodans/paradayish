We now have to apologise for the previous description of the lake we were supplied by the Rook.  As always, he was focussed on one thing, food (mainly the mans right eye) and so didn't really look around.  Luckily for us, whilst he still lies on the ground by the lake, our inquisitive sole observes.

Where to start though?  Let's start with his hands, as there is a pain forming in his left hand, it is in fact a painful cold moving from his nearly numb hand and slowly up his arm.  But why doesn't he feel the cold elsewhere?  Has something happened to damage the nerves there, was he in a fight.  He doesn't want to look, but goes to raise his hand over his eyes, and as he begins the motion, he hears a noise.  A splash of water from nearby.  So nearby in fact that he realises his hand is wet, having been in the lake since the start of the story.  He drops the hand to his forehand, breathing out a sigh of relief, and hoping that he starts to wake up, as things are going to move a little slow if he keeps forgetting such things.
