The shock of being so high surprised the Rook as it left, whilst it is used to flying, the act of leaving a room through a window is rarely met with clouds and migrating geese.  As it begins to fly, through the clouds, gliding along at the same speed as the ship, there is a tug.  This isn't a physical tug of a child at your coat, or a footballer in a last ditch attempt to earn their insane wage packets.  This was a tug inside it's skull, just between the eyes, and back about an inch, it didn't hurt, but it was as though a piece of fishing line had always been attached there, and was trying to pull you back in the most loving way, before a gentle fillet, and a hot bath.  The Rook cannot resist, and also does not appear to want to, it's course changes, and rises up the ship, slowly picking up speed and gliding past several windows without glancing in any of them.  Finally it comes across a shut window, with just enough ledge on the outside to stand and stare in.  At first it is hard to make out anything due to the reflection on that glass, but then, as its eyes become accustomed to the differing light levels, it sees what is tugging it, there on the bed, lies the man, awake, and waiting.
