At this thought, the Rook turns, and flies up to the main deck, landing just next to a large wooden wheel, used for steering this beast of an airship.  The main ticket was surprisingly clean, well preserved, and quiet.  The Rook had imagined a gaggle of rowdy, and drunk, shipsmen running about.  But there was no-one here, not even anyone at the main wheel, this at first felt odd.  Then, upon realising the repercussions of not having a pilot, the Rook decided to pick up the pace, as if his man died, the adventure would likely be over (and for some reason, he also thinks a lot more would end too).  The deck was wood boards, the sides had balustrades (made of wood), and also, there were various raised squares from the deck, with (wooden) hatches.  The number if nests this ship must have destroyed was immense, not to mention the current fire risk.
