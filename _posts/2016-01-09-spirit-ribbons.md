There was something else wrong about the drunken memory though, aside from the blurriness of it all, but he just couldn't quite grab the thread of it, as though he were looking for an Indigo spirit ribbon, but could only see in black and white.  Finally, one final piece of this memory flutters out of his mind, an object, he cannot tell what it is, but he remembers it being there, in his right hand, as he fell.

He closes his eyes, and tries to remember looking down at his right hand, hoping it will help with the recollection.  He sees a black ribbon there, which is strange, as this whole simile is confusing enough as it is without being able to notice a black ribbon in grayscale.  As his eyes try to focus on the ribbon, it starts to fade, as though the more he focusses on it, the harder it is to see.  Then, as he gives up, the ribbon abruptly explodes into a dust cloud, from which a Rook flies off, laughing as it leaves.

He sighs, opening his eyes, still lying on the soil, angry that the Rook was mocking his memories even after leaving.  He stares up towards the sky, and clenches his hands to test a theory.  The sad realisation hits him, his hands are empty, whatever it was he held when he fell is now gone.  As is the chance of a lead on the missing memory.
