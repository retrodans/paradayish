Around the furnace are a lot of cogs illustrated to show the pully system, each set with their own annotations, obviously referencing some other documentation in the office.  It is as though all the other elements have been developed individually, and only here is the grand plan displayed in it's mixture of electricity, fire, and brass.  Whilst the numbers mean very little, the Rook does notice one set of words and numbers in the bottom right which appear to be some form of label to the piece.  It reads: 'Kaiju 1:100' making the figure just a little shy of 100 feet.  What on earth could this be for, and where would it be stored safely?  You couldn't exactly hang it up on the coathook for safe keeping.  Even your average warehouse would be too small.  The Rook looks fearful at the pages, as whilst the size was something to be wary of, the side diagrams of various projectile weapons which can be chosen and slotted into the sides was a bit too much.
