Landing near the figure, it begins it's examination with the professionalism of a CSI.  Running over the usual steps it has gone through a thousane times before.  In it's mind, it recounts the results:

1. Does it smell? No worse than any other creature, maybe a slight hint of fish, but that may just be due to the viscinity of the lake

1. Is it breathing? It does not appear to be.  This conclusion is based on a lack of chest movements, and also that my beak does not steam up by its mouth

1. Has it already been part eaten? Not that can be observed, although it appears to have one molar missing towards the back of the mouth

1. Anything worth stealing? There appears to be a silver filling near the missing molar, which I will now attempt to pull out carefully...

As the rook reaches in and begins to touch a tooth, the lightning which was possibly in the birds eyes prior to this meeting is vented, in one fast and instant explosion.

**CRA-BANG!!!**
