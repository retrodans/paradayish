The ship rotates in the clouds, a huge goliath of the skies, towering down on everything below it, as if a strange god-like creature contemplating destruction, with the people below both fearful but also relieved that there are no tentacles involved.  As the beast pivots, its new destination comes into view, and even from this distance it looks glorious.  The buildings sparkle in the midday sun with their brassy coverings, glittering as the bright orb above shines onto various ages of weathered tiles on the rooftops, creating a kind of night sky, with each rooftop a star full of potential and hope.  The airways are busy a variety of flying contraptions (albeit much smaller than our airship), yet there are still even more fantastical things on the streets.  Small tin boxes with legs, losenges with wheels, and even a few orbs which appeared to move around on snail like goo.  This could be a lovely place to look around, if only there wasn't that small ominous element of terror around every corner, and a sense that things would not be getting better without a change of management.
