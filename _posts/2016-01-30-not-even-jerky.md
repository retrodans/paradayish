One sheet of paper, that is all sitting inside the dark wooden box!  The Rook, nearly jumps in and rips it to shreds in a fit of anger.  Why would someone lock a drawer for a single sheet of paper, where are the treats.  There should at least be some posh chocolates in there, or maybe a paper bag of Jerky, instead we are left with a yellowing piece of paper covered in scribbles.  But still, the drawer has been opened, so these scribbles are now under the protection (read ownership) of the Rook, and as such, the Rook first brushes all of the other papers from on top of the cabinet onto the floowr, before leaning into the drawer and pulling out the sheet, carefully laying it out onto the worktop to be examined.  Maybe it was a map to the kitchen, or a combination code for a trove of dragon treasure, one can never just dismiss these ideas without a little it of research.
