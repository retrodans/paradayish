In the classic style of a long-time partner in bed, the rook pokes the body, repeating the constant mantra of 'are you still sleeping?' over and over again.  Eventually getting bored and instead deciding instead to eat the right eyeball, seeing as that will either wake the guy up, or at the very least, be the most awesome pre-flight snack.

He climbs aboard the mans chin, and stares down with open beak, deciding whether to go in slow and steady, or just take a few jabs at it like a pot of olives.  It ultimately decides the best (read: most exciting) plan would be to swoop in and try and pluck the eye out without landing, that way, there would be a good story to tell at the next parliament, even if the eye got pulverized into mush.

But before the Rook ascends, something changes.  It finds that it's feet wont move, they feel stuck to the chin.  Also, whilst it can turn its head and body, the eyes remain fixed on the closed eyelids of the body, even so far as to rotate 180 degrees in the poor birds skull with the swivel of it's neck.

Then finally, with no visible motion, the mans eyes are open.
