Okay then, I have taken a few days break between chapters, and just wanted to post the work so far onto an online publishing service to see if that was of interest to people, and sparked further thoughts/conversation.

The service I went for was Wattpad, no real reason why, other than that the information seemed reasonable, and it allowed me to upload a chapter at a time, which works nicely for this style of story.

The other fun aspect of this work was that I had to design a front-cover for the book.  I didn't do anything fancy or complex, just a vector version of a piece of steam-punk art I saw in the Oxford Science Museum a few years back.  I kept the colors simple, using the brass based colors often thought of in the genre, which goes nice against the skull and probes, giving a sense of a cyborgian future, yet with a past steeped in steel.  One other reason why brown works well, is the imagery around soil, giving the piece a grounding in nature, as I am getting the impression the story could go in that direction in some areas too.

It was interesting doing a front cover when only one chapter has been written, but I am considering this part of the writing, as it is affecting the final story which is produced.
