For legs, there is nothing particular special as far as the diagram showed.  There were hinges where knees and ankles should be, and also feet where feet should be.  The Rook has gotten bored now, the excitement of the torso has made regular appendages nothing to write home about, but what next.  This information could scare a lot of people, so can it be sold, or maybe blackmail is an option?  Money does equal food after all, and you need to plan ahead, you never know what the winter might bring.  The Rook turns away from the paper, and leans towards a candle which it had previously knocked aside.  It takes a huge chunk out of the side, and begins to do something close to move its face in a way that can only be the best attempt to chew for a creature with a solid beak.  Whilst 'chewing', it turns back to the paper, and begins to roll the paper up with it's beak, and once rolled, spits the sopping wet candle wax onto the edge, sealing it with a stamp of its dinosaur talons to keep it all together.  The Rook then turns to face the door, before slyly swinging backwards with it's foot, knocking the paper behind the cabinet, into the gap it had made earlier, before then flying back to the window, and out to the world.
