In the blurry haze of the morning, a rook circles overhead, the protruding skull of this vicious bird shines in the morning sun, showing age-old scars along one side, showing the recordings of a fight long-past.  The bird is noticeable namely for the absense of others, it's lonely patrol a rarety in such creatures.  With eyes appearing to be fixed on a distant spot, they follow the source of their owners attention in the distance even as it turns in the sky, as though it were reinacting the worst spy movie ever, subtly pretending to just be browsing in a local Primarni store.  The rook continues to circle for a few minutes, but then something changes, a screetch louder than the bird has any right to make departs it's beak.  At the same time, it's head snaps downwards, looking straight towards the grass, a blue blaze of fascination appears in it's eyes, as dangerous as a lightning bolt sent from Zeus himself.  With the speed of a hummingbird, it descends towards the ground, a black dart on the blue sky scene, brining new colors into view.  Greens that may have been hills, yellows which may have been fields, all merging into a beautiful watercolor painting of the world, all is shown in sweeping strokes by the artist, except for one thing, the destination the rook is heading for.  On the ground, with a hand in a nearby lake, lies the figure, alone, and still.
