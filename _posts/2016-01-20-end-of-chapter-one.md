## End of Chapter One

Well, it has been a sedate start so far has it not.  Our man has awoken from a drug addled haze, with limited memories, and a Rook which is behaving strangely.  Then, as all was getting confusing enough, an airship comes along to lift him up into the sky, and towards a nearby city, with the intricate letter E adorning the sides of the ship.

What is all this about?  Chapter Two will be coming soon, so tune in to find out more, although I cannot promise there will be many answers (although I am sure we can get at least one in there).

Also, if you feel someone you know would be interested in this strange experiment, please do share it, whether on Facebook, Twitter, Email, airship, or some other manner of communication (Owl maybe?)
