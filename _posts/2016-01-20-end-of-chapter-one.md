## End of Chapter One

Well, it has been a sedate start so far has it not.  Our man has awoken from a drug addled haze, with limited memories, and a Rook which is behaving strangely.  Then, as all was getting confusing, an airship comes along to lift him up into the sky, with the intricate letter E adorning the sides.

What is all this about, Chapter Two will be coming soon, so tune in to find out more.
