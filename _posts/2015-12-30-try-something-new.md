I am not a huge fan of new years resolutions normally.  The idea of giving things up you like, or doing things you should be doing anyway but cannot normally be bothered.

That said, I am all for using it as a chance to do something new, something fun.  Therefore this year, I am going to attempt to write a story.  It will likely be pretty bad, but each post (daily with any luck) will be short, and the concept of this alone will be interesting for me to see how the story evolves over time.

There will be no edits

There will be minimal research

It will be 100% written by me

It may fail

Good luck, and if you decide to read this, I hope you have fun.
