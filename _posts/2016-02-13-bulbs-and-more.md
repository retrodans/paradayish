The rest of the body is similar, but with a lot more moving parts.  There are filament bulbs on the shoulders, as though there to strike fear in the same way spikes spikes might on a leather jacket.  Also, in the sternum of the body appears to be another vent, but much larger than that on the next plate.  Also, the gaps are much more open, letting in (or out) a lot more air.  It appears that this is some form of furnace though, due to a small illustration of a flame to the side, illustrated with eyes and a cheeky smile, whilst giving the thumbs up to the viewer.  The strange part though, is that it looks huge, I mean, how would a living person get in there without cooking within minutes.
