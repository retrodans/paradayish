As the clanking gets louder, a gust of wind works it's way through the trees, as though a perfectly timed omen for what was about to happen.  At the same time, on top of the cage, the dots throw a small block overboard, which just hangs a short distance below the ship.  Then, the noise of the clanking stops, and in the deathly still silence a noise echoes through the scene ... click.  As this sound is emitted, the block begins to plummet, fast, and down.  For a second, the mans curiousity wins out, even as the block gets closer, he tries to work out exactly what it is that has been dropped in the style of a comedy piano off the side of a flying airship, down onto his poor limp body.  From the fast decreasing distance, it appeared to be a scaled up version of one of those cranes you find in amusement arcades, for (attempting to) pick up a cuddly toy.

Once this second if intrigue passed over him though, the panic settled in.  From this angle, he couldn't even tell if the crane plummeting towards him was tied to anything, and even if it was, those arcade cranes were never exactly reliable in their gripping capabilities.  Ah well, there wasn't time to panic too much, as now it was only about 20 metres from his face, about to end this rather poor day.  As it descended a further 5 metre, there was one more click, as the crane opened up in a snap, and stopped plummeting for a moment, its enormous jaws wide, oil dripping from the hinges as though salivating for tasty man morsels.  As it hung there, the man hoped for one thing, and that was that there would not be another...

CLICK!

The crane drops the final 15 feet, digging its teeth into the ground to either side of his comparitively frail body.  His head sticking out of the top, imagining that his feet are doing the same at the other end, like a hotdog for a robotic Kaiju.
