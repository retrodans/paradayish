The intense stare from the mans dark eyes made our Rook feel a little uneasy.  Whilst they were brown eyes, they were still as close to black as you could imagine.  Also this stare was intense, and didn't really go with the unkempt brown hair by the lake, something has changed, a memory must have shown itself.  Whilst this would likely cause trouble, it could be the sort of trouble the Rook yearns for.  Namely trouble which resulted in treasure and food, but whilst that joy of glittery things passes, another feeling goes over him, not quite dread, more reluctance.  He someone now knew what was going to happen next, and it must be said, the Rook was not a fan.
