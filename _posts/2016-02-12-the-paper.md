The Rook slowly begins to run it's eyes over the paper, trying to understand what is in front of it.  At first it appears to be just a crudely drawn, yet meticulously annotated, illustration of some object, giving the impression of the early stages in a design or blueprint.  Whilst the general shape is humanoid, the edges are just a little too perfect, and the corners are too sharp.  Also, some of the shapes appear remeniscent of a post-apocalyptic scene, the sort the crow had seen kids playing in a game shop whilst it searched for hidden treasures in the outside bin.  Going from the top of the drawing, it shows the head as a trapesium stuck on top, with no visible neck, and the only gaps in the face for eyes, which appear to be behind a clear material and a fine metal mesh.  There is no space for a mouth or nose, although on closer inspection, the paper does show a side view of the figure aswell, and behind the head, where the neck would connect the two, appeared to be a small vent.
