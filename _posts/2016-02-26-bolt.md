The Rook glides over to the floor, picking up a small bolt of metal from a toolkit, then flying high into the sky, he swoops down towards one of the few things not made of wood, and releases the bolt.  It streams across the air, and smashes through the window pane in the center of the main deck door.  The Rook flies back to the wheel and waits, nothing happens, so it waits abother 10minutes, still nothing but silence.  So now it was time to enter the ship, the Rook raised itself into the sky, and expertly flew through the blades of glass, managing to not get clipped once.  The Rook was now in the boughs of the ship, time to explore a little more.
