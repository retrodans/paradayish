The rook, having been away for only a short while, saw the man pulled up onto the blimp.  Well, maybe he had been gone a little longer, but no more than a few hours, after all, he did stop off for a sandwich on the way back, collecting a lost morsel that a poor child dropped on the floor after some vicious creature (which may, or may not, have looked like a rook) landed on their shoulder.  As he got closer, he realised that he may also be in some manner of peril if observed by the same people that stole his ... person.  So, in an example of grace and agility none thought possible, he swiftly altered flight path towards the lake side, a good few meters from where the man had been laying.  The flight style was also changed from a planned approach, to something a lot more jaunty, others watching would have considered the flight of this black animal as drunken.  This assumption may not be too far from the truth, seeing as after the lunchtime sandwich, a quick sip from a local pubs pint glass was of course on the cards.

After landing on the grass, the bird looks up to the man being craned up into the air, shakes it's bird head, and lets out a sigh of frustration.  It then readies itself to rise back into the sky, ensuring that the paper strapped to its leg does not get damaged before it is delivered to the correct individual.
