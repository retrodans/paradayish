As the rook rises higher and higher, it keeps its body below the crane, reducing the chances of being spotted by anyone.  Then, as the man is pulled aboard in his black iron coffin, the rook darts under the ship, hovering for a moment, before nipping up the opposite side dashing straight through a porthole and into a dark room.  Only the light from the small porthole is able to seep through into this room, but that was enough to see that the room was in fact an office, with charts all over the walls.  Also, the tables were awash with blueprints for machines that would need at least 1 TED talk to explain their purpose.  The rook decides to wait it out until the man has been settled in before acting more, and anyway, scientists are known for leaving food lying around, so surely there was something in a draw, such as an emergency Twix or Freddo.  It was time to get some energy, and assess what this room was all about (then maybe eat some more).
