As the rooks eyes go around the room, looking in dismay at the mess and lack of food, its eyes fall onto one particular drawer.  Whilst all others are in various states of disarray, this one appears to have been shut neatly, with the key removed from the lock.  This would pique anyones interest, let alone someone with an abundance of self-worth.  The Rook takes great offence at this, wondering "who has the right to lock me out of this or any drawer, and also, what is worth so much to them that they feel it worth this level of offense".  The Rook hops over to the cabinet, and leaps up to the handle on the drawer below, putting it's eye up to the keyhole and peering in, as though sizing up the lock mechanism.  With this, it reaches in with it's beak, as careful as a surgeon, operating with a gun to their head.  It's beak goes in at a 20 degree angle at first, then when part-way in, it twists another 30 degrees clockwise, edging ever so slow lowly further into the lock, before clicking back to an exact 0 degree position.  Quite an ingenious lock mechanism, even with the key, unless you knew the type of lock, you would still be unable to open it.  As the rook hits that final position, the lock clicks down, and the rook retracts its vicious, yet expertly used tool, before posing in front of the drawer with pride, pretending that they are having a photo taken on safari, with the drawer being their recent kill of great size and danger.
