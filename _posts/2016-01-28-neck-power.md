Now that the drawer has been unlocked, and the Rook feels that any glory worth absorbing from the situation has been taken in by its adoring fans, the beak is now ready for it's next task, to prove it's worth even more.  The Rook jumps onto the table top, only slipping a fraction on the paper as it lands, although still scattering several sheets onto the floor in a shower of ideas.  From atop its plinth it reaches down with it's head, slipping its beak over the handle, and using it's neck muscles to edge the drawer open, you can hear the strangled grunting coming from the bird, similar to how you would imagine a bodybuilding gym for our feathered friends sounding.  This drawer may be a problem, being solid wood, the weight and friction of it all is causing more of an issue than expected, but this will not stop our hero (at least in his mind he is a hero), we just need to think this through a little bit first.
