“A constantly evolving far-fetched story, with regular (daily/weekly) installments”

The idea of this was to try and get into writing something. I don’t necessarily mind if it is good or not, but the creative process of writing anything was important to get away from the pure consumption lifestyle of TV/Podcasts I sometimes slide into.

I will try to write a short paragraph each day, or maybe a few in advance so it continues to publish whilst I am away.

The stories will all sit on github in the code, and are available to all to read.
