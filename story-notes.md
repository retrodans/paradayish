<h1 class="content-subhead">Story Notes</h1>

# WARNING SPOILERS #
The purpose of this file is for me to write notes about the key things happening which I may want to call upon later in the story, and evolve further

## Style
* Third-person POV

## Characters
* [Rook](/story-notes/characters/#rook)
* [Man](/story-notes/characters/#man)

## Locations
* [Lake](/story-notes/locations/#lake)

## Possible plot tools
* Rook has flown off towards trees from lake
* Blue lightning connection between rook and man
* Rook was looked in position, as if hypnotised, by the man, even though his eyes were close
* What was in the mans hand when he collapsed?
* Man has only moved his hands and eyes so far, paralysed? Misdirection?
