<h1 class="content-subhead">Story Notes</h1>

# WARNING SPOILERS #
The purpose of this file is for me to write notes about the key things happening which I may want to call upon later in the story, and evolve further

## Style
* Third-person POV

## Characters
* [Rook](/story-notes/characters/#rook)
* [Man](/story-notes/characters/#man)

## Locations
* [Lake](/story-notes/locations/#lake)

## Other references
* [Spirit Ribbons](http://new-age-spirituality.com/spirit/color.html)
  * Indigo = Spiritual (he was looking for this)
  * Black = Unconscious, mystery

## Possible plot tools
* Blue lightning connection between rook and man
* Rook was locked in position, as if hypnotised, by the man, even though his eyes were close
* What was in the mans hand when he collapsed?
* Man has only moved his hands and eyes so far, paralysed? Misdirection?
* Huge airship (5x20) with a branze box, with wooden cladding (busy with beings, that appear to work in unison) - there is a bell
* A kind of lego architecture
* Ornate E, inside an orb, with wings, he recognises, friend? plan?
* Message on rooks foot
* The blueprints in the office (where the rook is)
* He appears to not be a badly treated prisoner so far (bar the anklet and locked room)
* Sense of wonder and terror about the steampunk city the ship heads for



## Next steps
* Closes out with the ship turning and flying towards a city, describe the city from a distance (steampunk)
As the crane settles onto the airships boards, those surrounding it detach the cables, and tidy everything away.  Pulling apart the lego-like structure which had been created, and tidying their toys away neatly, just like every parents dream.  The man feins unconsciousness, and allows those around him to detach the crane, and carry him away.  They seem gentle (well, as gentle as sailors can be), and rest him on a soft bed in a room, granted they chain his ankle, and lock the door, but that only seems fair.  The time for resting was over though, now it was time to think, and if possible, remember.

*
The ship rotates in the clouds, a huge goliath in the sky, towering down on everything below it.  As it turns, the new direction comes into view, and even from this distance it looks glorious.  The rooftops shine with metallic tiling, the airways are busy with much smaller flying contraptions, and there are even more fantastical things on the streets.  Small tin boxes with legs, others with wheels, and even a few which appeared to move around on goo.  This could be a lovely place to look around, if only there wasn't that small element of terror around every corner.
