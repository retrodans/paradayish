<h1 class="content-subhead">Story Notes</h1>

# WARNING SPOILERS #
The purpose of this file is for me to write notes about the key things happening which I may want to call upon later in the story, and evolve further

## Style
* Third-person POV

## Characters
* [Rook](/story-notes/characters/#rook)
* [Man](/story-notes/characters/#man)

## Locations
* [Lake](/story-notes/locations/#lake)
* [Ship]

## Other references
* [Spirit Ribbons](http://new-age-spirituality.com/spirit/color.html)
  * Indigo = Spiritual (he was looking for this)
  * Black = Unconscious, mystery

## Possible plot tools
* Blue lightning connection between rook and man
* Rook was locked in position, as if hypnotised, by the man, even though his eyes were close
* What was in the mans hand when he collapsed?
* Man has only moved his hands and head so far, paralysed? Misdirection?
* Huge airship (5x20) with a bronze box, with wooden cladding (busy with beings, that appear to work in unison) - there is a bell
* A kind of lego architecture
* Ornate E, inside an orb, with wings, he recognises, friend? plan?
* Message on rooks foot
* The blueprints in the office (where the rook is)
* He appears to not be a badly treated prisoner so far (bar the anklet and locked room)
* Sense of wonder and terror about the steampunk city the ship heads for



## Next steps
CHAPTER TWO - next bits
* Rook is in the main hall, several (2 on left, 3 on right) shut doors off to the sides, flickering light at end around corner to right (fire)
* Opens room 1 (somehow): cupboard
* room 2: another cupboard
* room 3: a third cupboard
* room 4: A wash room
* room 5: A larder - intense descriptions go here
* Round corner is the kitchen, but another door on the right before the kitchen, the mans room, Rook enters this room
* Message is on foot still, time to deliver
* Rook gets named, man gets a mission to clear up some answers

NEXT: Rook goes through ship, investigating, nearly dying several times, eating lots, before finding man.
