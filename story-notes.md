<h1 class="content-subhead">Story Notes</h1>

# WARNING SPOILERS #
The purpose of this file is for me to write notes about the key things happening which I may want to call upon later in the story, and evolve further

## Style
* Third-person POV

## Characters
* [Rook](/story-notes/characters/#rook)
* [Man](/story-notes/characters/#man)

## Locations
* [Lake](/story-notes/locations/#lake)

## Other references
* [Spirit Ribbons](http://new-age-spirituality.com/spirit/color.html)
  * Indigo = Spiritual (he was looking for this)
  * Black = Unconscious, mystery

## Possible plot tools
* Blue lightning connection between rook and man
* Rook was locked in position, as if hypnotised, by the man, even though his eyes were close
* What was in the mans hand when he collapsed?
* Man has only moved his hands and eyes so far, paralysed? Misdirection?
* Huge airship (5x20) with a branze box, with wooden cladding (busy with beings, that appear to work in unison) - there is a bell
* A kind of lego architecture
* Ornate E, inside an orb, with wings, he recognises, friend? plan?
* Message on rooks foot
* The blueprints in the office (where the rook is)
* He appears to not be a badly treated prisoner so far (bar the anklet and locked room)
* Sense of wonder and terror about the steampunk city the ship heads for



## Next steps
CHAPTER TWO - next bits
* Rook feels a pull in it's mind, encouraging it to go up, and towards the helm of the ship, finds a specific window, and peeks through, there is the man
* Rook describes the room the man is in, he lies, eyes open, looking at the ceiling, thinking, ends with man turning to look at the Rook, Rooks emotion goes from concern as to what is happening, to reluctance over what will happen next
* Rook flies up to main deck, lands just out of sight, explain the ship we are on
* Rook slowly edges it's way to a door leading into the ships hull, and heads in
NEXT: Rook goes through ship, investigating, nearly dying several times, eating lots, before finding man.











The shock of being so high suprised the Rook as it left, whilst it is used to flying, the act of leaving a room through a window is rarely met with clouds and migrating geese.
