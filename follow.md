## RSS
To do this, you will need an rss reader.  I find [feedly](http://feedly.com/) great for this, and then a mobile app (such as greader on android) to get these, and read through them.

The feed can be retrieved at:
<a class="pure-button" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/paradayish">RSS</a>

(if above doesn't work, <a href="{{ site.url }}rss">try this link</a> instead)

At the moment, as the posts are longer than twitter, I do not know of a better way to publish the content, although I am ready to listen, so please do contact me with ideas.

## Mailchimp

WooHoo, we now have daily emails setup for you to try out:
